# lorenz_animation
Animation structure for the 1963 Lorenz system of ordinary differential equations, using a Runge-Kutta integrator within a fourth-order scheme.

Integration function created with lots of help from 
Steve Brunton's YouTube channel, incorporation of functions into
an animation scheme with changeable Lorenz parameters was done 
by Dylan Roy.
